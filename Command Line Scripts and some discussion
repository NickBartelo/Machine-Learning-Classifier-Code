In order to use liftOver from the UCSC Genome Browser, it is necessary to change the data in the following ways:
1. Create 3 blank columns in the dataframe
To do this, import the vcf into a Jupyter Notebook Python Dataframe using the following function:
def read_vcf(path):
	with open(path, 'r') as f:
    lines = [l for l in f if not l.startswith('##')]
  return pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(''.join(lines)), dtype={'#CHROM': str, 'POS':int, 'ID':str, 'REF': str, 'ALT': str, 'QUAL': str, 'FILTER': str, 'INFO': str}, sep='\t').rename(columns={'#CHROM': 'CHROM'})
This will work on any vcf, as long as it is correctly formatted.

To create three blank columns use the following code:
human_derived_SNV_data['..'] = '.'
human_derived_SNV_data['...'] = '.'
human_derived_SNV_data['....'] = '.'
The above creates columns with dummy data in them. It is necessary to have in order to run bedtools intersect and ANNOVAR annotations in the future. 

2. Keep the data that is currently stored in the column names of the dataframe
Before changing column name headers to CHROM, POS, etc., you must keep the information from the current header and create a new row for it using the code:
An example is shown below:
human_derived_SNV_data.loc[-1] = ['1', '379177', '.', 'G', 'T', '.', '.', '.']
human_derived_SNV_data.index = human_derived_SNV_data.index + 1  # shifting index
human_derived_SNV_data = human_derived_SNV_data.sort_index()

To change header use code:
dataframe.columns = ['CHROM', 'POS', 'ID', 'REF', 'ALT', 'QUAL', 'FORMAT', 'INFO']
It is not possible to use bedtools intersect for a vcf with any header, even a blank line. 
Therefore, this header needs to be cut out before running the command line tools, which will be discussed in the command line documnet for the human derived data.



3. Export the new dataframe as a vcf
The following code changes the dataframe into a vcf file containing a header:
header = """##fileformat=VCFv4.1
##fileDate=20090805
##source=myImputationProgramV3.1
##reference=file:///seq/references/
#CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO"""
output_VCF = "humanderivedSNVs.vcf"
with open(output_VCF, 'w') as vcf:
    vcf.write(header)
human_derived_SNV_data.to_csv(output_VCF, sep="\t", mode='a', index=False)

You will notice a new file in your Jupyter Notebook home entitled 'humanderivedSNVs.vcf'
