In order to use liftOver from the UCSC Genome Browser, it is necessary to change the data in the following ways:
1. Create 3 blank columns in the dataframe
To do this, import the vcf into a Jupyter Notebook Python Dataframe using the following function:
def read_vcf(path):
	with open(path, 'r') as f:
    lines = [l for l in f if not l.startswith('##')]
  return pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(''.join(lines)), dtype={'#CHROM': str, 'POS':int, 'ID':str, 'REF': str, 'ALT': str, 'QUAL': str, 'FILTER': str, 'INFO': str}, sep='\t').rename(columns={'#CHROM': 'CHROM'})
This will work on any vcf, as long as it is correctly formatted.

To create three blank columns use the following code:
human_derived_SNV_data['..'] = '.'
human_derived_SNV_data['...'] = '.'
human_derived_SNV_data['....'] = '.'
The above creates columns with dummy data in them. It is necessary to have in order to run bedtools.
