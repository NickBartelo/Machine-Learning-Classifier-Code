Up to this point, I have created four essential files for the two machine learning models to be developed:
1. benign_coding_region_variants.csv
2. pathogenic_coding_region_variants.csv
3. benign_noncoding_region_variants.csv
4. pathogenic_noncoding_region_variants.csv

These files contain the annotated variants mapped to the nORFs database of the lab for a specific region (coding and noncoding) 
and with specific features (benign or pathogenic).

Using Python, I used a new Jupyter Notebook given to me by Narendra Meena, a member of the Prabakaran lab. 
To use the features of this document, one must first open the Python terminal and run the following commands:
1. pip install pandas
2. pip install sklearn
3. pip install matplotlib
4. pip install shap
