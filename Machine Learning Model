Up to this point, I have created four essential files for the two machine learning models to be developed:
1. benign_coding_region_variants.csv
2. pathogenic_coding_region_variants.csv
3. benign_noncoding_region_variants.csv
4. pathogenic_noncoding_region_variants.csv

These files contain the annotated variants mapped to the nORFs database of the lab for a specific region (coding and noncoding) 
and with specific features (benign or pathogenic).
